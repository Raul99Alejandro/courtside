## F-1: Vega SDK has no Windows path
- Task: set up Vega development on Windows 11
- Steps: read install docs; searched for WSL guidance
- Expected: a Windows or WSL route, or a cloud simulator
- Actual: macOS/Ubuntu only; virtual device needs KVM/Hypervisor.framework, so WSL/VirtualBox fail
- Severity: major
- Workaround: wait for a Mac; plan B Fire OS device
- Suggestion: state Windows unsupported on the first page, and offer a hosted Vega Virtual Device or WSL2 nested-virt guide
